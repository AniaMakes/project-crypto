# Project Crypto

Create a web app that displays the latest crypto currency prices

* Fetch pricing data from the [Crypto Compare API](https://www.cryptocompare.com/api/) and display it
* Add functionality enabling the user to add new currencies to display list as well as remove them
* Implement the client using [Socket.io](https://socket.io) to display streaming data
* Add visualisation using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) to create visualisations of the data you find interesting
* Add unit tests to as much of your code as possible
